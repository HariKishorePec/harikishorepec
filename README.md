#### Projects

Some of my College Projects includes,

##### College Website Renovation
- Renovation of our College website. Contributed as _Frontend Lead_. Its a collaboration project that, not only taught how team works shapes you and your work, the great learning experience, but also, how important it becomes to decide the technology stacks you choose for a project. We built our site on Bootstrap 4, since Responsiveness was on our prime focus, as it lagged in our previous version. We built our own full CMS (Content Management System), for ease and maintainance of our site, which takes care of all functionality, like Faculty Registration, daily News and Notice Updates. Sources are private but, You might have a look [at here](https://cms.pec.edu)üôÇ.
##### ICON 2019
- Website for Department Fest. This was my First Real Life project, that ignited spark of doing more of its kind. Had great learning experience. Again, a collaboration project with one of friends and classmate. Please [see here](https://github.com/HariKishorePec/ICON-WEBSITE#icon-website) for more.
